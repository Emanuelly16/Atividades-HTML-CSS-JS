    <H2>Tradução</H2>

    God of creation<br>
    There at the start<br>
    Before the beginning of time<br>
    With no point of reference<br>
    You spoke to the dark<br>
    And fleshed out the wonder of light<br>
    And as You speak<br><br>
    A hundred billion galaxies are born<br>
    In the vapor of Your breath the planets form<br>
    If the stars were made to worship so will I<br>
    I can see Your heart in everything You've made<br>
    Every burning star<br>
    A signal fire of grace<br><br>
    If creation sings Your praises so will I<br>
    God of Your promise<br>
    You don't speak in vain<br>
    No syllable empty or void<br>
    For once You have spoken<br>
    All nature and science<br>
    Follow the sound of Your voice<br>
    And as You speak<br><br>
    A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath<br>
    Evolving in pursuit of what You said<br>
    If it all reveals Your nature so will I<br>
    I can see Your heart in everything You say<br>
    Every painted sky<br>
    A canvas of Your grace<br>
    If creation still obeys You so will I<br>
    So will I<br>
    So will I<br><br>
    If the stars were made to worship so will I<br>
    If the mountains bow in reverence so will I<br>
    If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I<br>
    For if everything exists to lift You high so will I<br>
    If the wind goes where You send it so will I<br>
    If the rocks cry out in silence so will I<br>
    If the sum of all our praises still falls shy<br>
    Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times<br>
    God of salvation<br><br>
    You chased down my heart<br>
    Through all of my failure and pride<br>
    On a hill You created<br>
    The light of the world<br>
    Abandoned in darkness to die<br>
    And as You speak<br><br>
    A hundred billion failures disappear<br>
    Where You lost Your life so I could find it here<br>
    If You left the grave behind You so will I<br>
    I can see Your heart in everything You've done<br>
    Every part designed in a work of art called love<br>
    If You gladly chose surrender so will I<br>
    I can see Your heart<br><br>
    Eight billion different ways<br>
    Every precious one<br>
    A child You died to save<br>
    If You gave Your life to love them so will I<br>
    Like You would again a hundred billion times<br>
    But what measure could amount to Your desire<br>
    You're the One who never leaves the one behind<br>
